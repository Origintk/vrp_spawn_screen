The following resource will prompt players with a menu the first time they joine the server,
after the resource have been installed. The menu will let the user type in their characters first name, last name, age and gender.
This information will be updated in the vrp identity table,
and the user will be spawned in as a random male or female ped model at the train station in los santos.
